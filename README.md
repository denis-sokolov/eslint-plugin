# Theorem JavaScript/TypeScript linting tool

This tool provides some benefits on top of eslint:

- **Setup**. Eslint out of the box does not support TypeScript or React, this comes with both preconfigured;
- **Team rules**. This includes code patterns the team finds valuable. [The list](./src/rules);
- **Configuration**. At three levels of strictness, this allows to choose the correct set of rules prepared for you;
- **Project-specific rules**. Convenient setup to write [custom project-specific rules](docs/custom-rules.md).

[Get started](./docs/setup.md).
